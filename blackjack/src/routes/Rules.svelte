    <h1>Blackjack Rules</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Goal:</strong> Get as close to 21 as possible without going over. Beat the dealer’s hand.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Card Values:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Number cards are worth their number.</li>
          <li>Face cards (J, Q, K) are worth 10.</li>
          <li>Aces are worth 1 or 11 (whichever is better for your hand).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>How to Play:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Both player and dealer get two cards. One of the dealer’s cards is hidden.</li>
          <li>Player goes first and can “Hit” (take a card) or “Stand” (end turn).</li>
          <li>If the player goes over 21, they bust and lose.</li>
          <li>Once the player stands, the dealer reveals the hidden card and must hit until reaching at least 17.</li>
          <li>If the dealer busts, the player wins.</li>
          <li>If neither busts, the closest to 21 wins. Ties are a “push” (no one wins).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
